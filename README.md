# Covid-Community

This Sinatra application was built to highlight an important need in today's coronavirus-plagued world: community members who need food should be able to connect with volunteers and vice versa.

This simplistic CoVID Community application is designed for community members to be able to create a profile on the site and then create delivery requests. Volunteers can sign up to fulfill those requests, and mark when requests are completed.

In troubling times, the power of humanity is through COMMUNITY. Showing up for each other. This application is my attempt to foster that sense of community.

## Installation

Fork and clone this repository down to your local environment, then run 'bundle install' to install all required gems from the Gemfile.

## Usage

To get the application up and working, run the `shotgun` command from your command line and visit localhost:[port-number] (the port number will be specified after running shotgun).

Sign up for a new member/volunteer profile (or log in if you already have a profile) and then navigate through the site using the hyperlinks in the upper-right-hand corner (home, profile, members, volunteers, and log out). Create a new delivery request if you're a member, or edit the statuses of applicable delivery requests if you're a volunteer.
